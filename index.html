                            I began coding in third grade, with Scratch (obviously). At first, I  <i>strongly</i> disliked everything to do with Scratch. I vowed to never code again.
                            You see how that went. (Hint: that resolution was broken, just like almost all other potentially life-changing resolutions I make). I picked up programming
                            again in eighth grade, learning JavaScript on Khan Academy. In ninth grade, I joined a FIRST Robotics team, and I haven't looked back since.
