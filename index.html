                            I began coding in third grade, with Scratch. At first, I  <i>strongly</i> 
                            disliked everything to do with Scratch. I vowed to never code again. (Hint: that resolution was broken). 
                            I picked up programming again in eighth grade, learning JavaScript on Khan Academy. In ninth grade, I 
                            joined a FIRST Robotics team, and I haven't looked back since.

                            I've been on two <a target="_blank" href="https://www.firstinspires.org">FIRST Robotics</a> teams:
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://techhounds.com/">Team 868<a/> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.team4926.org/">Team 4926</a>. 
                            Some projects I have worked on include motion profiling, writing vision code so the robot can align automatically, 
                            designing and wiring an electronics board, and tuning lots and lots of PID loops. I was nominated for the Dean's List 
                            Semifinalist award by Team 4926, and I will volunteer as a CSA (control systems advisor) at any competitions my team 
                            is not attending in the 2019-2020 competition season.

                            This section can probably be divided into two parts: listening and playing. I greatly enjoying imposing my music taste on other people.
