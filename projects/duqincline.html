        Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
        With the specter of having to leave Pittsburgh looming over me, my projects this semester were colored by nostalgia for a place in which I still existed. For my DigiTOOL final project, I decided to create a scale model of one of Pittsburgh's most iconic attractions: the Duquesne Incline.

        It started off in Fusion, where I created five boxes to represent the 6 mm plywood that would comprise the sides and floor of the model. I then added the windows, the cutout for the door, and notches to hold the roof in place. Creating the roof was challenging, as I had no idea where to begin with its odd shape. I sketched the outline of it in 2D and extruded it, using the chamfer and filet tools as needed. The roof was 3D printed out of PLA, and then covered with modeling paste and painted with acrylic paint to resemble wood. The plywood was sanded and painted with acrylic paint, with the windows cut out of clear acrylic and press-fit (semi-successfully).

        The goal is to eventually create an incline and use a rope to either manually or electronically move it up and down. So far, the main struggle has been sourcing material for this, as I would need fairly long and robust pieces of thin wood.
