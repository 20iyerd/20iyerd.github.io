        Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
        With the specter of having to leave Pittsburgh looming over me, my projects this semester were colored by nostalgia for a place in which I still existed. For my DigiTOOL final project, I decided to create a scale model of one of Pittsburgh's most iconic attractions: the Duquesne Incline.

        It started off in Fusion, where I created five boxes to represent the 6 mm plywood that would comprise the sides and floor of the model.
