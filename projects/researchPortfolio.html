            To whom it may concern:<br><br>
            This page is intended to serve as my portfolio for my AP Research class. My research centers around the idea
            of promoting equity among high-school teams in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Teams participating in
            the FIRST Robotics Competition must overcome many obstacles before being able to successfully build a
            competitive robot. Fundraising enough to sustain the team, gaining mentor support, and finding a space to
            work are just a few of the examples of necessary components to a team which are not traditionally
            considered. Teams from lower-income schools or communities are more impacted by these obstacles, and must
            work harder to be successful in competition.

            <br><br>

            I've been concerned with equity of STEM education throughout my high school experience, as I have had the
            privilege to participate on two FRC teams. I decided to investigate whether the efforts that the Game Design
            Committee (which designs the game released to teams each year) has been making to promote equity are truly
            effective. Plenty of data has been collected on team performance during competitions, and using Python data
            analysis libraries, I am able to analyze whether teams which face more difficult obstacles have been
            improving their performance (on average) as a result of more equitable games.

            <br><br>

            I have sectioned off each artifact in this portfolio in a timeline in order to demonstrate how my work has
            progressed. I have organized my artifacts in chronological order (in accordance with the timeline). I
            begin with one of our first assignments in AP Research after deciding our topics. This preliminary chart was
            assigned in late August. My last artifact is code that I have written in preparation for beginning my
            research.

            <br><br>

            All my artifacts are original content (created in some way by me) because no single source has significantly
            impacted my research. I believe this shows the originality of my research. Very little research has been
            done on the FIRST Robotics Comeptition other than collecting data about demographics and the positive
            impacts of the program. Reading these statistics and realizing the true impact of this amazing program was
            inspirational. I decided to take a slightly different approach to my research, and I believe that it has a
            great deal of potential to positively impact the creation of future FRC games. As a result, more teams
            facing significant obstacles will be able to achieve competitive success.

            <br><br>

            All of my artifacts will help anyone interested in my research understand the rationale behind the process I
            am using. Initially, it is quite confusing to grasp the many factors which play a part in my research. The
            charts and diagrams lay out the methodology sequentially and logically, allowing the reader to think through
            it. My Sticky Note Chart is similar, in that it organizes each of the sources I am using into categories
            which reflect each step in my research. Personally, all five of these artifacts will allow me to stay
            organized in the process of writing the code for my project and keep track of the variables being used.

            <br><br>

            Sincerely,

            <br><br>

                    This artifact does not necessarily take an "angle" on my research. Rather, it is the first time I
                    consolidated my ideas on paper and began to shape the direction it would take. The problem
                    statement written here is the result of a great deal of revision and refining with my original
                    ideas. I also was able to establish the value of my research, which is not very apparent to an
                    external reader.

                    We filled these charts out when preparing to submit our proposals for research to the Institutional
                    Review Board. Following a chart asking yes or no questions, we were able to gain an idea of how
                    many ethical considerations our projects had and what to prepare for. This was especially applicable
                    to those with human subjects, but I was fortunate enough to not have to worry about dealing with
                    human subjects or submitting survey questions to the IRB. Regardless of the lack of ethical issues
                    with my project, outlining the process and implementation details was helpful. I had to section off
                    the vague ideas I had into concrete and distinct steps in order to create the chart. I was able to
                    realize the next steps to take in my research.

                    This poster served as a preliminary, rough outline of what my paper will eventually look like. It
                    outlined the specific sections which will be present in the paper, such as the Research Question,
                    Hypotheses, Assumptions, and Definitions. Outlining each of these sections was similar to
                    deconstructing the paper and focusing on individual sections at a time. Via the oral aspect of the
                    project, I was able to gather feedback from peers and identify flaws in my methodology as well as
                    areas I may have missed that are confusing to a reader.

                    This artifact differs from the others, since it focuses less on process/methodology and more on how
                    to use the sources I have found to give the reader context in my paper. My annotated bibliography
                    was organized into sections, but it still wasn't entirely clear how the different sources connected
                    to each other. By writing summaries of each source on a sticky note, I could manipulate their order
                    and see how to best write the introduction of the paper.

        Through looking back through all the work I have done in the past semester, I was able to regroup my thoughts
        and understand where I am in my research. This was especially helpful after the stress of finals week and all
        the other end-of-semester activities going on. I was able to make a plan of what I need to do in the near future
        in order to be ready to dive into my research next semester.

        <br><br>

        Looking back at the five artifacts I chose, I began to think more about why I didn't use any external sources as
        an artifact. As I explained in the cover letter, much of my research is original and has very little literature
        in academia available. Although the literature review and the annotated bibliography were challenging to
        complete, I will be able to use the sources I have to provide sufficient context to the reader. It is often
        difficult for people who haven't experienced FRC to understand what it is and how it works. Outlining the
        sources with artifact 4 allows me to explain the context in a more organized way.

        <br><br>

        I've learned a lot from doing this portfolio; some of the things I learned are related to AP Research and my
        project, but some skills I developed were not directly related. One of the biggest results of this portfolio was
        improving my HTML knowledge and skills. I decided to host the portfolio on my website as I realized that images
        are easier to embed in HTML, and I would have more flexibility in terms of formatting. Normally, I use LaTeX
        documents in this class, but the portfolio presented an opportunity to do something new. In relation to my
        research, however, the main thing I learned was how far my topic has developed. When we were choosing topics, I
        was very indecisive and torn between a few topics. After analyzing all the formative work we did in the class, I
        realize that I chose a good topic to stick with.

        <br><br>

        In the process of creating this portfolio, I began to think about what I could potentially do in the future with
        the topic I chose. It would be an interesting project to create a neural network to generate the most equitable
        FRC game it can, and train it with the data I collect in my research right now. I originally began thinking of
        incorporating this idea into my main research project, but it requires a lot of in-depth training, practice, and
        application before I gain the skills to be able to complete the idea. However, it may be worth pursuing in the
        future!
